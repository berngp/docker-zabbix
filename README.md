Docker Zabbix
========================

## Container

The container provides the following *Zabbix Services*, please refer to the [Zabbix documentation](http://www.zabbix.com/) for additional info.

* A *Zabbix Server* at port 10051.
* A *Zabbix Java Gateway* at port 10052.
* A *Zabbix Web UI* at port 80 (e.g. `http://$container_ip/zabbix` )
* A *Zabbix Agent*.
* A MySQL instance supporting *Zabbix*, user is `zabbix` and password is `zabbix`.
* Supervisord managing the processes (`http://$container_ip:2812`, user `'myuser'` and password `'mypassword'`).


## Usage

You can run Zabbix as a service executing the following command.

```
docker run -d -P --name zabbix  berngp/docker-zabbix
```

The command above is requesting *docker* to run the *berngp/docker-zabbix* image in the background, publishing all ports to the host interface assigning the name of **zabbix** to the running instance.
Run `docker ps -f name=zabbix` to review which port was mapped to the container's port '80', the *Zabbix Web UI*.

Open `http://<ip of the host running the docker deamon>:<host port mapped to the container's port 80>/zabbix`

In the example bellow the container's port `80` is mapped to `49184`.

```
$ docker ps -f name=zabbix
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                                NAMES
970eb1571545        berngp/docker-zabbix:latest   "/bin/bash /start.sh   18 hours ago        Up 2 hours          0.0.0.0:49181->10051/tcp, 0.0.0.0:49182->10052/tcp, 0.0.0.0:49183->2812/tcp, 0.0.0.0:49184->80/tcp   zabbix
```

If you want to bind the container's port with specific ports from the host running the docker daemon you can execute the following:

```
docker run -d \
           -p 10051:10051 \
           -p 10052:10052 \
           -p 80:80       \
           -p 2812:2812   \
           --name zabbix  \
           berngp/docker-zabbix
```

The above command will expose the *Zabbix Server* through port *10051* and the *Web UI* through port *80* on the host instance, among others and associate it with the name `zabbix`.
Be patient, it takes a minute or two to configure the MySQL instance and start the proper services. You can tail the logs using `docker logs -f $contaienr_id`.

After the container is ready the *Zabbix Web UI* should be available at `http://$container_ip/zabbix`. User is `admin` and password is `zabbix`.


### Apparmor Specifics (Debian and Ubuntu)

The container uses Monit for controlling and observing the individual processes, which requires capabilities denied by Docker's default Apparmor profile. Currently, the only workaround is to add the `trace` capability and running the container without being fenced by Apparmor, using following flags in the `RUN` command:

```
--cap-add SYS_PTRACE  --security-opt apparmor:unconfined
```

Not doing so will result in a *vast* number of log messages polluting your syslog, as Monit tries to trace the processes all 10 seconds!


## Exploring the Docker Zabbix Container

Sometimes you might just want to review how things are deployed inside a running container, you can do this by executing a _bash shell_ through _docker's exec_ command.
Execute the command bellow to do it.

```
docker exec -i -t zabbix /bin/bash
```

## Issues and Bugs.

Feel free to report any problems [here](https://github.com/berngp/docker-zabbix/issues).


# Developers

I suggest you install docker through your distribution, if using Mac OSX I suggest you leverage [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/), as an option the project has a *Vagrantfile* that you can use to create a virtual instance with _Docker_.

## Setting your Docker environment with the Vagrantfile

To run the included _Vagrantfile_ you will need [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) installed. Currently I am testing it against _VirtualBox_ 4.3.6 and _Vagrant_ 1.4.1. The _Vagrantfile_ uses a minimal _Ubuntu Precise 64_ box and installs the _VirtualBox Guest Additions_ along with _Docker_ and its dependencies. The first time you execute a `vagrant up` it will go through an installation and build process, after its done you will have to execute a `vagrant reload`. After that you should be able to do a `vagrant ssh` and find that _Docker_ is available using a `which docker` command.

*Be aware* that the _Vagrantfile_ depends on the version of _VirtualBox_ and may run into problems if you don't have the latest versions.

## Building the Docker Zabbix Repository.

Within an environment that is already running _docker_, checkout the *docker-zabbix* code to a known directory. If you are using the _Vagrantfile_, as mentioned above, it will be available by default in the `/docker/docker-zabbix` directory. From there you can execute a build and run the container.

e.g.

```
# CD into the docker container code.
cd /docker/docker-zabbix
# Build the contaienr code.
docker build -t berngp/docker-zabbix .
# Run it!
docker run -i -t -P --name=zabbix berngp/docker-zabbix
```
